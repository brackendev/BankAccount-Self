"[Self] was first used as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s. ... Self was designed mostly by [David Ungar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ungar) and [Randall Smith](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:118) in 1986 while working at Xerox PARC. Their objective was to push forward the state of the art in object-oriented programming language research..." *â€” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language))*
